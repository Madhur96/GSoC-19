This itinerary is perfect because:
1. Least commute time - it explores nearby places in one go
2. Verifed - I myself followed this and is modifed based on my experience
3. You will get their best view at each place - places are timed according to their key attraction. Like _Nahargarh fort_ is good for day time so kept in the morning schedule while _Chowki Dhani_ is good for evening.
