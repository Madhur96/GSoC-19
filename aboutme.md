### My story

I was once the quintessential introvert, the guy who preferred solitude over socializing. Life was predictable and almost monotonous. My days were structured, my thoughts quiet, and my world, though comfortable, felt incomplete.

School wasn’t particularly exciting. It was a routine of lectures, assignments, and a social sphere I never connected with. I was the "quiet kid," the one teachers appreciated for being well-behaved. Friendships were limited, and I found solace in the certainty of my own space.

Things changed when I made it to IIIT Hyderabad, a turning point that reshaped me entirely. College was a whirlwind of opportunities, challenges, and self-discovery. It was there that I learned to open up, not just to people but to experiences. I started to talk, to laugh, to explore.

But the most transformative part of my journey was travel. It started small — a weekend trip with friends, a solo journey to test my limits. Each journey taught me something new: how vast the world is, how small my worries are, and how much there is to learn from people and places. Travel became my therapy, my source of fulfillment.

After college, I stepped into the corporate world. While the job keeps the bills paid and the ambitions alive, I realized early on that my soul needed more. My heart found joy in things beyond the office — like contributing to causes close to me. Whether it's volunteering for educational programs or supporting environmental initiatives, these moments of giving back keep me grounded.

Today, I lead a life of contrasts. Monday to Friday, I’m a corporate professional, immersed in meetings and deadlines. On weekends and vacations, I’m a traveler and a contributor, seeking meaning and purpose beyond the cubicle.

Looking back, my journey from an introverted kid with a mundane routine to an ambivert who finds joy in exploration and giving back feels surreal. It’s a reminder that growth happens when you step out — of comfort zones, of old mindsets, and into the world.
